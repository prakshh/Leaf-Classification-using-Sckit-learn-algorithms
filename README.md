There are estimated to be nearly half a million species of plant in the world. 
Classification of species has been historically problematic and often results 
in duplicate identifications. Automating plant recognition might have many 
applications, including:

  Species population tracking and preservation
  Plant-based medicinal research
  Crop and food supply management

The objective is to use binary leaf images and extracted features, 
including shape, margin & texture, to accurately identify 99 species of plants.
Leaves, due to their volume, prevalence, and unique characteristics, are an
effective means of differentiating plant species. 
They also provide a fun introduction to applying techniques that involve 
image-based features.
